Whenever you are writing Angular code, make sure to:

- use standalone components and directives
- use inject() function to inject dependencies from Angular DI (dependency injection)
- use Tailwind CSS for styling
- apply the DRY principle
- apply the SOLID principles
- define types and interfaces when they are needed
- instead of creating one big function, separate the functionality and modularize it.

Please do not write comments like "// example function implementation", always provide full implementation when writing code.
